  - Find F4FEVR (in Fallout4VR and check "show unofficial lists") and install into same hard drive where Fallout 4VR is (Make new folder "WabbaF4FEVR" to disks root)
  
  - Hope that it just works.


Open folder where you installed.

Copy the files from "Game Folder Files" to your Fallout 4VR game folder.

Open MO2 that was just downloaded.

Run F4FEVR from MO2.


Start new game.

When you have pipboy, open NAC X configuration holotape.

Save and exit.


Activate FRIK in MO2.

Run F4FEVR from MO2.

Enjoy your adventure!

## Tips

- Do not save in power armor.
- Power armor helmet can be configured with PA Helmet Configuration holotape.
- If aiming with scopes seems off, edit BetterScopes.ini eyeOffset value (Default was 2.65) This may depend on headset and/or your pupil distance. You can also set your dominant eye here.
- Activate and customize survival with Advanced Needs 76 Holotape. Do not select vanilla Survival difficulty if you want to use this. Installed but not activated by default.
- Activate "Right Grip to Interact - UI fix" in Optional files/MO2 if you use SteamVR to change right hands A and Grip buttons.


## Notes:
This version does not include Luxor HD textures to keep download size reasonable and fast as we're in testing phase.

Made "FRIK F4FEVR" Valve Index controller profile to steamVR based on /u/rollingrock16 setup. Use "Right Grip to Interact - UI fix" with this.

I do not know what are good for other controllers.
