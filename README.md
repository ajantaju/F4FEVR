## Tips

- You can visit mods Nexus page by right clicking on a mod on the list and selecting "Visit on Nexus" (3rd from the bottom)
- Do not save in power armor.
- Power armor helmet can be configured with PA Helmet Configuration holotape.
- If aiming with scopes seems off, edit BetterScopes.ini eyeOffset value (Default was 2.65) This may depend on headset and/or your pupil distance. You can also set your dominant eye here.
- Activate "Right Grip to Interact - UI fix" in Optional section/MO2 if you use SteamVR to change right hands A and Grip buttons.

## Testing Phase

- Customize survival with Advanced Needs 76 Holotape. Do not select vanilla Survival difficulty if you want to use this. Activate in MO2 and start testing.
- MCM and Portable Junk Recycler Mk 2 are added as untested mods, go test them!

## Notes:
This version does not include Luxor HD textures to keep download size reasonable and fast as we're in testing phase.

Made "FRIK F4FEVR" Valve Index controller profile to steamVR based on /u/rollingrock16 setup. Use "Right Grip to Interact - UI fix" with this.

I do not know what are good for other controllers.
